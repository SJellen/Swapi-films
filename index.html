                In his absence, the sinister
                FIRST ORDER has risen
                from the ashes of the Empire
                and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi,
                has been destroyed.
                
                With the support of the REPUBLIC,
                General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE.
                She is desperate to find her
                brother Luke and gain his
                help in restoring peace and
                justice to the galaxy.
                
                Leia has sent her most daring
                pilot on a secret mission
                to Jakku, where an old ally
                has discovered a clue to
                Luke’s whereabouts … .
